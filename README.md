# 🔫 AssaultCube Trainer (C++)

Welcome to my very first **game trainer** (aka cheat) for **AssaultCube**, written in **C++**.
This project marks the beginning of my journey into **game hacking** and **reverse engineering**, so don’t expect anything fancy yet.

I'll be improving over time as I learn more, but for now, I just wanted to release this basic trainer to share with others and track my progress.
